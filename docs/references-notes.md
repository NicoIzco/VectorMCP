# Reference scan notes

Quick context checks requested by spec:

- `faiss-node`: confirms Node bindings around FAISS and CPU-friendly similarity search patterns.
- `github-mcp-server`: confirms practical MCP server shape and endpoint design for listing/invoking tools.
- `awesome-mcp-servers`: used to align naming and compatibility expectations for MCP implementations.
- `RepoPilot` / `EvoAgentX` mentions: taken as directional examples for tool routing and agent orchestration expectations.

These references informed architecture choices in this MVP: local-first indexing, semantic query endpoint, and MCP-compatible tool schema output.
